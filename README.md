A simple AI-assisted project for me to practice web development, MCP, AI-enabled IDEs, wispr flow and a little bit of math that I don't get to do so much anymore!

Feel free to tinker around with the replication chance, death chance, crowding coefficient and initial population. The model will calculate the theoretical carrying capacity and graph the population over time and the delta versus population.

Logistic growth model (delta = (replication chance - death chance - (crowding_coefficient * population)) * population) used, maybe will implement other models in the future.
